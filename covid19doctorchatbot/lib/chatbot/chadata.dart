  "COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.",
  "People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. \n\nThe disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. \n\nThese droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. \n\nOther people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. \n\nPeople can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. \n\nThis is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.",
  "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. \n\nSome patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. \n\nSome people become infected but donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. \n\nMost people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. \n\nAround 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. \n\nOlder people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. \nPeople with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.",
  "Some patients have pneumonia in both lungs, multi-organ failure and in some cases death.",
  "People can help protect themselves from respiratory illness with everyday preventive actions. \n\nAvoid close contact with people who are sick. \n\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. \n\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.",
  "to keep from spreading respiratory illness to others, you should \n Stay home when you are sick. \n\nCover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash. \n\nClean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. ",
  "There is currently no vaccine to protect against COVID-19. The best way to prevent infection is to take everyday preventive actions, like avoiding close contact with people who are sick and washing your hands often.",
  "There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. People with COVID-19 can seek medical care to help relieve symptoms."
